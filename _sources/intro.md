## Predictive coding

On this few pages, I will try to provide access to predictive coding to a wide audience. 
The objective is to cover the maths of predicitve coding, as well as different flavors of predictive coding with its use cases. 
I will provide jupyter notebooks on how to implement the different models.

Of course this is a work in progress. If you have feedback or questions please do contact me!
